    In this study you earned 1 point per tree. 
    Imagine the co-label would have multiplied the points earned for each tree you cut down. 
    This multiplier could earn you more (above 1) or earn you less (below 1) per tree. 
    <br><br>
    Example 1: having an eco-label would have increased the pionts per tree to 1.25 points per tree. 
    <br><br>
    Example 2: having an eco-label would have decreased the points per tree to 0.75.
