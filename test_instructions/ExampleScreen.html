    On the next screen, you can get familiar with the decision screen.
    <br><br>  
    The screen will look exactly the same as the decision screen in round 1. 
    <br>
    You will have in total 120 seconds to do so, or whenever you submit a valid answer.
    <br>
    Again, the next screen is not the real decision screen yet, but a practice.
