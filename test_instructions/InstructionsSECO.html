<p>
    Please read the instructions carefully before you start.The payment you receive at the end of the study depends on your choices and the choices of others. 
    The whole study consists of two parts: Part 1 is described below and payment relevant, part 2 consists of questionnaires.
    In addition to the points that you earn from part 1, you also earn <b>X Euros</b> as a participation fee.
    
    <br><br>
    <h4>Part 1</h4>
    In part 1, you will interact with 3 copmuterized participants for several rounds. 
    You and the other 3 participants, share a <b>common forest</b>. You can each cut down trees to produce goods. 
    Each tree that you cut down earns you points.
    This part <b>can last up to 10 rounds</b>.
    
    <br><br>
    <b> The forest </b>
    <br>
    At the start of part 1, the forest <b>contains 100 trees</b>. 
    The regrowth rate of the forest is <b>40 trees per round</b>. This means before each round (starting in round 2), 40 new trees are added to the forest. 
    For example, if no trees are cut in the first round, the second round will start with 140 trees in the forest. 
    Be aware, <b>once the forest has no more trees, this part of the study ends</b> even if you are not in round 10. 

    <br><br>
    <b> Your decision </b>
    <br>
    In each round, you and the other computerized participants decide individually on how many trees you want to cut down from the common forest.
    You have the option to cut down any number of trees between <b>0 and 20 trees per round</b>.The trees you cut down are equal to the points you earn and will be converted into your profit at the end.
    <b>Every tree cut down equals 1 point </b>. Each point is worth 10 cents, which leads to the following conversion rate:
    <br><br>
                <b>1 point = 0.10 Euros</b> (10 Points = 1 Euro)
    <br><br>
    During this part, you have the opportunity to earn an eco-label! Your production must be sustainable to earn the eco-label.
    If you cut down 10 or fewer trees <b>in every round</b>, your production is considered sustainable. 
    Once you cut down more than 10 trees in any round, your production is not sustainable anymore and you lose the eco-label. 
    If you earn the eco-label, your points per tree will remain the same.  
    
    <br><br>
    <b>BE AWARE!</b> Part 1 ends after 10 rounds, or when the forest has 0 trees left.
    If the forest has 0 trees left, the forest dies and part 1 ends. This means that there are no rounds left to cut down trees and earn points. 
    This also means that <b>you do not get any points in the round in which the forest died </b>.
    <br><br>
    <b> Left-over trees</b>
    <br>
    For every 10 trees left in the forest at the end of the study, we will plant one tree in real life. 
    <br><br>
    <b> Decision Screen</b>
    <br>
    When you make the decision, you see different pieces of information. There will be an example trial before the payment-relevant choices start. In that round, you can get used to the setup of the decision screen.
    On each decision screen, you will see:
    <br><br>
           - Which round you are currently in
    <br><br>
           - How many points you have earned up to now, how many trees you have cut down up to now, whether you still have an eco-label, 
    <br><br>
           - How many points all 4 participants earned together, how many trees all 4 participants cut down in total, how many of the 4 participants still have an eco-label
    <br><br>
           - How many trees are left in the forest
    <br><br>
    After each decision, you will see an information screen about how many trees were cut down in the last round, and also whether the forest is still alive.
    <br><br><br>
    <h4>Part 2</h4>
    In part 2 you will be asked to fill out some small questionnaires.  
    <br>
